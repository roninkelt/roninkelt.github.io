## Roleplaying Games

A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.

I both design and play rpg's. My personal preference for both is those with an emphasis on building a strong narrative and character development.

## Creative Writing

I'm an amateur author as well. I write screenplays, short and long form fiction. Still working on perfecting my craft and have not as yet published or produced anything commercially.

## Visual Effects 

According to wikipedia.com Visual effects (commonly shortened to Visual FX or VFX) are the various processes by which imagery is created and/or manipulated outside the context of a live action shot. Visual effects involve the integration of live-action footage and generated imagery to create environments which look realistic, but would be dangerous, expensive, impractical, or simply impossible to capture on film. Visual effects using computer generated imagery has recently become accessible to the independent filmmaker with the introduction of affordable and user friendly animation and compositing software.

Visual effects may be divided into at least four categories:

* Matte paintings and stills: digital or traditional paintings or photographs which serve as background plates for keyed or rotoscoped elements.
* Live-action effects: keying actors or models through bluescreening and greenscreening.
* Digital animation: modeling, computer graphics lighting, texturing, rigging, animating, and rendering computer-generated 3D characters, particle effects, digital sets, backgrounds.
* Digital effects (commonly shortened to digital FX or FX) are the various processes by which imagery is created and/or manipulated with or from photographic assets. Digital effects often involve the integration of still photography and computer generated imagery (CGI) in order to create environments which look realistic, but would be dangerous, costly, or simply impossible to capture in camera. FX is usually associated with the still photography world in contrast to visual effects which is associated with motion film production.

My day job is as a Digital Compositor.  I take all the pieces that everyone else on the film generates - green screens, cgi, matte paintings, etc, it could be dozens of pieces.  Then I turn them into the believable imagery that you see on screen. My hands are the last to touch a shot before it goes out the door of a vfx facility.

I love doing it. The job is both creatively and technically challenging and no two projects are quite the same.

## A Common Thread

Running through everything above is storytelling. I love to tell a story, whether it be to an audience of 200 or the 5 players sitting around the table with me.
